What I did:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
July 13'24:

13:49 added hover effect for Call-to-actin buttin in herof-label
13:53 Gave up on hover effect for hero-label and deleted the new codes so I don't have redundant code sitting around
14:10 Still working on <picture> tag for hero image. Trying to figure out what size to use.
14:19 Used Chat-gpt to figure out why image was still larger on website than the image size showed. 
14:22 Noticed in larger.css I had two home-main tags and deleted one of them

14:27 noticed home-main had no spacing between top and div .hero so I'm wondering why there's so much space at the top
14:30 i tried to commentout the medium.css to see what happened and learned most my hero-label code is in medium.css 

14:31 moved the navigation stuff to medium.css. Not really sure but a part of methought "Medium.css should be for the not as small stuff" but 
honeslty it probably dosen't make too much of a difference.

14:36 I sent my css to chatgbt to see if there were issues and it consolidated my code so I deleted stuff in all my css
 to use chatgbt consolidated stuff (It looks like it just reordered stuff) but when i did that it didn't change what I was 
 hoping so I deleted that and went back to my origanl css files.


15:00 I messed around with the hero responsive image design. It's responsive but while I was changing the sizes I noticed when I got really small 600x518
my image didnt work (I JUST REALIZED THE IMAGE IS SET TO BE 600X600 SO OF COURSE IT WONT WORK IN 600X518 BECAUSE MY IMAGE IS 600X600)

15:11 I figured out how to fix the hero image! I just didn't name the file right lol thats why the above issue didn't work
_______
15:30 I pushed my changes to github! Not finished but I need a break

18:13 Added the shadow-box shading to the navigation and considering doing that to the home-main
 class as well

18:16 added the shading to the home-main as well. I'll get a second oopinion on weither i should stick with it or not later

18:54 added the products and a section for number of orders

18:05 added home-products as the cards

18:15- created json products to get it ready for products page

19:36 tried to create order.js 

19:44 I created order.js, I don't know if it works since I didn't work on the orders page 
but I have it sort of set up for later

20:28 Tried to figure out how to make the state and street and zipcode requirements
 but I don't think i did it right. They won't turn red if nothing is inputed
 Also I have no idea how to put the Product Identifier - in a hidden field not visible to the user  
 while not shwoing the user. Was I suposed to do this in products?

 20:38 I created an aboutus page and added css for it. I'm not sure how I'll feel about it tomorrow, 
I probably shouldn't have started another page, but I knew I was going to keep obsessing about it
if I didn't at least start and create the other pages to get the nav working.

20:45 I also added a products.html page because I knew the nav issue would drive me crazy and I ddin't want to risk forgetting to change order.html to products.html
But I realized earlier that I didn't need my hero image to have source images. Just in the about page.
So I'm debating using a new hero image for the index page. Because reguardless I'm going to be using the nemo images for my 
about us page because I REFUSE to redo the work unless the professor asks. I really need to make sureI
I'm understanding the instructions because I think I'm doing things out of order. (Sigh) I dont
know what to tell you Cayleigh, I think we're geting to excited about this project
for now I'm going to go to bed because as you can see I've been doing this almost all day. Otherwise I'm going to get 
caught up in details that I don't need to. 

20:52 I realized the footer image didn't have alt tags so I added those and I'm validating the html for index
about-us, and products to check it.


July 15:
12:51- Im looking over what I need to do and reviewing code-notes.txt and updateing my goals for the site
14:57 figuring out what to do
15:29 -- getting frusterated because now all my images are moveing out of view when in mobile. I thought this was fine yesterday
but I had a merging error so I'm not sure if thats the reason or what I messed up. Using chatgpt
which says that it could be the margin/padding conflicting so I'm commenting out the padding 
unless its in home-main or hero-label.
15:32 I commented out the nav in the larger since I had same code in medium,
Around this time it dawned on me everything I did the other day got deleted and cried a lot

21:13 I tried to do box shadow and it kindof workedd. 
then i realized the sticky element no longer worked, couldn't figure out why everything after putting in the code.
21:20 sticky element now works, I forgot to add the top:0;

21:32 I tried to figure out how to get the image to its own size. So I got rid of width:100% 
but now it aligns to left. I'm trying to figure out how to align things to the center
21:34 I figured out the reason some of the stuff kept going out of place. I had larger set to 600px not 800px. 
22:00 I changed css sizes and tried to figure out the hero image sizes


22:40 i figuredc out hero sizes best I could but now I have an error where the label button seems to be 
besides the hero image and stuck there no matter what mobile size it's in. 
Also  deleted "margin:0;" and   "padding:0;" from the body in the base.css  
22:46 FIGURED OUT THE ButTON ERROR  I kEPT GETTING!
 I had to put the button tag INSIDE the <a href> tag!
 Nevermind that was not the case.

 23:11 order.html page I tried to add order-main to css border.

 23:28 I've een workin on the order page. I don' tknow if I like this, but
 I made it so the shadow is red if it's invalid. Not sure i like it.
 Tried to add border-bottom-color: but it dosen't look like its working.

 I think i got the order page working 

 23:50 (11:50 pm) Okay I think I finally got order.html somewhere. I fifgured out how to 
 make something "requrired" I was supposed to type required in those sections (facepalm)
 It's all good, at least I eventually figure dit out, I'm getting tired though so I'm 
 going to copy a-fina-project to my backup folder because I'm terrified of the same issue happening again
 Fingers crossed i wont lose everything I just did. 

JULY 16 2024
 12:02AM I tried to add a pattern to phone but you know what I'm done with the form pagae 
 until i figure out the other stuf. I'm going to look over things once more with validation 
 and then go to bed.I got a busy day tomorrow/today.
 12:23 okay that took forever to validate, but I'm done now. I'm going to copy this to backupa
 And then hopefully push to github. 

21:38 after getting help from professor and my teammate on API and Forcast (around 15:30)
I was left to figureout the placement. I added Justify content to forecast in base.css and 
I think I did something else beforehand as well, but I can't recall what i did. 

I'm trying to figre out the home-products spacing. Because the images are almost 
on top of each other and then spanningof the page when it's in mobile mode

 I found out the grid-template-column code isn't running because of the @media tag, 
 so I'm moving it to another css file

20:53 home-main seems like it's bigger than the body? (the div is bigger than the white space in the body)

21:00 commented some code out in the base.css

I noticed that order-main was similar to the code in home-main, so I just changed "order-main" to "home-main"
Never mind i was somehow not calling order-main correctly. I just fixed something ( dont rememeber What) and now works. 

21:20I was working with the products because I noticed the "city" was showng as street address.
Then i noticed that the "logo" was showing two times in the base while I used the web dev
So I merged the two logo Id's into one

21:26 I'm getting tired so I'm going to validate the code, see what I can fix, 
and call it a night for this. 


jULY 17

 11:32  made list of what I'd need to do today
 [work in products]
 looked over chamber directory.js and compared to professors 

 I changed the name of some of the titles "Product-identifier" to "sku" for example because I wanted to shorthand it.
 It started because it lookd like Product-name was not accepted by the js code. (the "name part" in product-name was crossed out.) I changed it do "productName"
 I ended up changing productName to title

 17:21 reviewin what i need to do:
  fix darkmode contrast, 
  fix button error
  fix products error where images are not showing, 

  17:40 I messaged professor and now I'm going to get started with the about-us page because I can do that
  with minimal help from the professor. 

  I tried to make the about-us.html main be connected to the hero tag, but then it learned that it has a grid layout 1/4 so the 
  paragraphs [<p></p> tags] were all besides each other instead of on top of each other. So I decided I had to create more code insetad for about-me. 
  I think I'll make it "about-text" because I don't know what else to name that section for the main image of the page.
  
  I used chatgpt and it gave me the idea to use "about-content" and "about-header" So that is the name for the text now.
  
  18:20 I figured i might ned to make the body of index.html 1fr 2fr instead but im not sure how 
  that will work
  
  18:28 I DID IT!!! I FINALLY GOT THE GOOGL EMAPS CENTERED IN the MIDDLE OF THE PAGE!! FINALLY AFTER A FULL SEMESTER
  (I put it in a div, properly named it and added display: flex to the #google-maps section and then justify contented it to center.)
  
  21:37 

  22:-- fixed copyright error that was making it go to a fourth column instead of the bottom. I also fizd the font size not changing. 
  
  22:33 I fixed the  error  of the about-main stacking paragraphs side by side by inputting 
  .about-main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;}

23:12 I added social media tags, fixed the grid issue and also fixed footer logo width and height

July 18 2024
12:18I changed dark mode so that it looks more smoother I just need to fix dark mode 
contrast errors

[[10:30ish  I worked with professor on javascript for index and  about-me.
 I still need to work on:

 about-us:
 media query is being funny-I think its because I set it to max width

 borders on the images being the same on Index and products. 
 connect javascript orders.js to index. Figure out code for it
 
 Multi pages: media query
 Check anywhere with a TO DO comment and work on that
 
 Dark mode: delete dark mode. I apparently misread the instructions and never needed it in 
 the first place. I was very embrassed when I found out becaus I thought I saw it on the "rubric"
  but I'm just losing it. Professor was very nice about it though. 


]]

July 19 2024
I'm very aggitated so hopefuly I can get some focus done,,

right now: I'm going to look through the pages and figure out what comments i have in TO DO

As of right now on page [.html] I have "TO DO " comment of:
Index.html:
 TO DO: CHANGE  A href="" TOLINK TO CORRECT ORDER PAGE--> **I THINK this means conenct to products to n   not order.html)
<!-- TO DO : figure out why Link is not accepted in validator --> ** SHOULD BE FINISHED BUT WILL Check

INDEX.html
ensure images have broders similar to other pages 
delete images not connected to json


Products.html:
[No to do noted but I do need to do do the following]
Fix grid for products stuff
find a way to say "on click lead to this page"
ensure order.js is connected 
Orders.html is connected somehow
order-confirmation is connected 

ORDER.html:
This is more of a note but a TO DO i had was:
 THIS PAGE ONLY SHOWS IF YOU ADD STUFF TO CART, PRODUCT NEEDS HREF"ORDER.HTML" BUT THATS IT 
meaning this page should only pop up if a customer clicks on a product and it sucessfully
 gets appended to a list on localStorage 

ORDER-CONFIRMATION.html
No to do list but 
-ensure it only shows up AFTEr products is clicked on


BASE.CSS
Not a TO DO but a TO add: 
FIGURE OUt FOOTER ERROR 
FIGURE OUT GRID FOR PRODUCT

IN TO DO: (HIGH PROORITY TO LESS)
Does border-color actually work? I'm pretty sure mulan is being used in a different class
MAKE WEATHER AT BOTTOM ORDER TO WHERE BOTTOM WAS


14:47 I took the copyright out of the footer to the bottom of page. I don't care anymore. 
I also tried to fix something else but i cant reacall
For some reasn the footer is set to four columns so I'm trying to figr eout why from 
the webdev, but it wasn't showing me more than one grid-template-columns
 so I'm trying to figur eout why the heck the footer has five grids

i'm going to try to fix products so that everythig is side by side.  but first I need chips I'm soo hungry
 name 

(4:25): I got the grid stuff working in products.html!! Now I'm going to fix the issues of the images not showing.

(10:20): i updated some links into JSOn file

I learned that some of my links were amng the few to get reverted/deleted along with some images.
 So i found and resized/changed to webp a backpack that I've wanted from avatar the last airbender loungefly section

(10:38)  I'm trying to figure out why the image hasn't downloaded to github yet so in the meantime
I'm going to just focus on getting the borders to work on products.html page.

(11:18) I updated the image, I played aorund with the base.css to try to get the porducts
 working properly. The set up seems to be somewhatfunctional. 

(11:46) used chatgbt for the "fetch-button.js" and then added the javascript link to products.html

JULY 20 2024
12:08 Well never mind, turns out all i needed to do was add " <button class="buy-button">Buy Now</button>" to display-products. 
I also added a windows lick that my teammate showed me how to do.

12:12 Just learned orders.html didn't have State as a requirement so I'm working on that too
that should be fixed

12:15 Now I'm going to have to figure out what errors I'll need  to fix, but i got a button 
added. I just need to figure out how I'm going to do the math calculations and stuff like that.

12:20 Now I'm updating some stuff. I asked chatgbt how to add a "cart" function and going through somethings. 

I'm at least adding "data-sku="${product.sku}">Add to Cart</button>" to the button section in display-products.js

In display-products I have a button function that tells products to do something. I'm gettingti
tired so Its best I probbaly just finish seeing if I can create a cart in order.thml and then 
find ways to make it work tomorrow. 

12:35 well somehow I made it worse. The footer, order div and form stuff are all stacked besides each other

12:36 Never mind I figured out it was because I accidentally set another main beneath the form. It's fized now. 

So now I'm hapily going to bed so i can debug tomorrow. Good night world. 

Never mind I was worried I forget this so I'm at least adding this note for future me:

Cayleigh look at the chamber/join.html and make layout almost exactly the same, except for members, make the members section the Cart section. 
ALSO DOUBLE CHECK RUBRIC. Cart may need to be someplace else instead. I know it MUST be in the index.html
So beware. Dont code and sleep. 

16:14 I figured out why the footer was having issues. I accidentally commented out
 "display:grid" 
 which is essential to maing the grid line work. (in larger.css)
 Now I just need to figure out how to get everything in line in mobile mode.

 I just learned that stuff in products.html is not longer worng. What the heck??

17:07 I changed produts.html footer width and height
now im going to see if I can find out why index.html products are showing but not products.html

Okay i put everything through chatgbt and figured out it was mainly javascript error. 
I have no memory of changing the stuff chatgbt told me to change, 
but now something is displaying. For some reason the imageURLs are not working so the images
are not appearing on the page. but progress!

I also noticed the button in Javascript no longer has a connection to order.html. So there's something.

it almost looks line line 9-14 on display-products.js is not fully connected. ALL the image 
descriptions have "an undefined image" but when I click on IMAGEURL all the images are conencted to github.
Maybe it's because I changed the size? But the links should be unchanged. Im going to copy the'
 links to some of the images in "products.json" and see if that changes anything/

Nope that didn't do anything. But I must have did something. 

This is why you don't code while sleepy. don't snooze and script

17:32 I'm going to try to work on the about-me page, but  I at least got the section borders working on both
the index.html and products.html so it SHOULD look somewhat similar to each other. 


18:00 I'm now working on media query

18:34 okay I thin I got the media query workng decently well. I added a media query that would
change the background to all white if the px screen 

but now I need to figure out how to get the header "Enchanted backpacks" TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
WHEN SCREEN IS SMALL
