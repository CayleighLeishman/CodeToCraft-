What I did:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
July 13'24:

13:49 added hover effect for Call-to-actin buttin in herof-label
13:53 Gave up on hover effect for hero-label and deleted the new codes so I don't have redundant code sitting around
14:10 Still working on <picture> tag for hero image. Trying to figure out what size to use.
14:19 Used Chat-gpt to figure out why image was still larger on website than the image size showed. 
14:22 Noticed in larger.css I had two home-main tags and deleted one of them

14:27 noticed home-main had no spacing between top and div .hero so I'm wondering why there's so much space at the top
14:30 i tried to commentout the medium.css to see what happened and learned most my hero-label code is in medium.css 

14:31 moved the navigation stuff to medium.css. Not really sure but a part of methought "Medium.css should be for the not as small stuff" but 
honeslty it probably dosen't make too much of a difference.

14:36 I sent my css to chatgbt to see if there were issues and it consolidated my code so I deleted stuff in all my css
 to use chatgbt consolidated stuff (It looks like it just reordered stuff) but when i did that it didn't change what I was 
 hoping so I deleted that and went back to my origanl css files.


15:00 I messed around with the hero responsive image design. It's responsive but while I was changing the sizes I noticed when I got really small 600x518
my image didnt work (I JUST REALIZED THE IMAGE IS SET TO BE 600X600 SO OF COURSE IT WONT WORK IN 600X518 BECAUSE MY IMAGE IS 600X600)

15:11 I figured out how to fix the hero image! I just didn't name the file right lol thats why the above issue didn't work

15:30 I pushed my changes to github! Not finished but I need a break

18:13 Added the shadow-box shading to the navigation and considering doing that to the home-main
 class as well

18:16 added the shading to the home-main as well. I'll get a second oopinion on weither i should stick with it or not later

18:54 added the products and a section for number of orders

18:05 added home-products as the cards

18:15- created json products to get it ready for products page

19:36 tried to create order.js 

19:44 I created order.js, I don't know if it works since I didn't work on the orders page 
but I have it sort of set up for later

20:28 Tried to figure out how to make the state and street and zipcode requirements
 but I don't think i did it right. They won't turn red if nothing is inputed
 Also I have no idea how to put the Product Identifier - in a hidden field not visible to the user  
 while not shwoing the user. Was I suposed to do this in products?

 20:38 I created an aboutus page and added css for it. I'm not sure how I'll feel about it tomorrow, 
I probably shouldn't have started another page, but I knew I was going to keep obsessing about it
if I didn't at least start and create the other pages to get the nav working.

20:45 I also added a products.html page because I knew the nav issue would drive me crazy and I ddin't want to risk forgetting to change order.html to products.html
But I realized earlier that I didn't need my hero image to have source images. Just in the about page.
So I'm debating using a new hero image for the index page. Because reguardless I'm going to be using the nemo images for my 
about us page because I REFUSE to redo the work unless the professor asks. I really need to make sureI
I'm understanding the instructions because I think I'm doing things out of order. (Sigh) I dont
know what to tell you Cayleigh, I think we're geting to excited about this project
for now I'm going to go to bed because as you can see I've been doing this almost all day. Otherwise I'm going to get 
caught up in details that I don't need to. 

20:52 I realized the footer image didn't have alt tags so I added those and I'm validating the html for index
about-us, and products to check it.
