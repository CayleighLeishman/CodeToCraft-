What I did:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
July 13'24:

13:49 added hover effect for Call-to-actin buttin in herof-label
13:53 Gave up on hover effect for hero-label and deleted the new codes so I don't have redundant code sitting around
14:10 Still working on <picture> tag for hero image. Trying to figure out what size to use.
14:19 Used Chat-gpt to figure out why image was still larger on website than the image size showed. 
14:22 Noticed in larger.css I had two home-main tags and deleted one of them

14:27 noticed home-main had no spacing between top and div .hero so I'm wondering why there's so much space at the top
14:30 i tried to commentout the medium.css to see what happened and learned most my hero-label code is in medium.css 

14:31 moved the navigation stuff to medium.css. Not really sure but a part of methought "Medium.css should be for the not as small stuff" but 
honeslty it probably dosen't make too much of a difference.

14:36 I sent my css to chatgbt to see if there were issues and it consolidated my code so I deleted stuff in all my css
 to use chatgbt consolidated stuff (It looks like it just reordered stuff) but when i did that it didn't change what I was 
 hoping so I deleted that and went back to my origanl css files.


15:00 I messed around with the hero responsive image design. It's responsive but while I was changing the sizes I noticed when I got really small 600x518
my image didnt work (I JUST REALIZED THE IMAGE IS SET TO BE 600X600 SO OF COURSE IT WONT WORK IN 600X518 BECAUSE MY IMAGE IS 600X600)

15:11 I figured out how to fix the hero image! I just didn't name the file right lol thats why the above issue didn't work
