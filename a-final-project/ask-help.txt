I need help with:

-do I need exact links for images that I used?


products.html:
NONE OF MY IMGAES INCLUDING FAVICON WORKS IN THIS PAGE. 

Fixing what I assume is a parse error. (json is not showing images in products.html)
for some reason Favicon won't work (Get javascript cart working first though)

have other errors in validator as well that I can't understan (It says i can't have link above body?)

ALL PAGES:
Javascript for cart stuff/order page


Index.html:
There seems to be three columns in the grid layout and the second is very skinny,
 not sure where it's comming from, but it's affecting the layout of page. I'm 
 not sure whats making the second column so narrow.

in mobile view the section cards stack on top of each other.

order.html{
how do I make hidden project identifier 
how do I make it work with cART?
Why is cart not going under the form when grid is smaller?
}

order-confrimation.html



OTHER:
For order.html chatgbt suggested I  add a @media query for a max width so that it goes to one column. but that's not similar to how chamber is done
I want to figuer out why chamber works and mine does not.
