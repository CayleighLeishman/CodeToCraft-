            <h3>Senario 1:</h3>
            <img src="images/ana.webp" alt="college student">
            <p> Ana is a broke student looking for an Disney Princess backpack-preferably Aurora based-
                at a discount. She can't afford the $60 bags that are selling on Loungefly sites, but she 
                has been dying for an Disney princess based bag and is determined to get One princess loungefly bag this year. 
            </p>

            <h3> Senario 2:</h3>
            <img src="images/andy.webp" alt="a father looking at a computer">
                <p>
                    Andy wants to spoil his teenager with a horror based loungefly backpack, but between child support, 
                    and a broken down house that contstantly seems to need fixing, he can't seem to save more than $45 
                    before needing to spend it away.
                </p>

            <h3>Senario 3:</h3>
            <img src="images/robin.jpg" alt="a woman looking skeptical">
            <p>
                Robin is looking for a backpack for the Disney trips that she spent 7 years saving. 
                Her favourite travel bag just broke and her friends have been raving About
                these so called loungefly bags. From what she can see though, they're typically small, 
                so she's not sure if she's commited to saving up $75 on a small backpack. Not with all 
                the medicine she has to carry around.  
            </p>
            <h3>Senario 4:</h3>
            <img src="images/gus.jpg" alt="a business man looking at computer egarly">
            <p>
                Gus has been collecting loungefly bags for quite a while. But his wife is pregnant and she's 
                been on his case for spending too much money on collecting bags. This time he has a limted budget
                and he wants to find some bags that he thinks his future son would like.
