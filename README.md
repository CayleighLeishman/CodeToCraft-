Creating a Student-Personal Website Where I utilize new concepts of Web Development

# Description
Through this website, I acquired new knowledge and coding techniques to enhance website efficiency. I learned to effectively utilize WebDev tools such as Lighthouse, the Console, and Networking.

I also improved my CSS writing skills, overcoming personal challenges in this area. I discovered the importance of working with the given resources to ensure efficient code rather than pushing too hard.

Additionally, I gained insight into the significance of appropriately sized images. It's not always about smaller sizes; utilizing various file types is crucial for optimizing load times.
